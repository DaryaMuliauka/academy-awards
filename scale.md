### SCALE

- Perform load and stress testing of the application. This is how the application performance indicators will be known
- Divide the application into microservices by domain and function, if some modules will be especially loaded
- Scale application(or microservices). CI/CD with Docker or other container and Kubernetes/OpenShift (K/OS) as container manager. K/OS can scale services up/down depending on the load on a particular service. 
- Also, if some service has a high load on a GET request that requires data from many other microservices, it is possible to implement the CQRS pattern.
- Cache movie data with Redis or another service after updating ratings from OMDB
- add some Monitoring service
